# mirror-neutron
A collection of code written for work at the ORNL mirror neutron project
- avgTotal.py is used to show the average x, y, z components for each sensor for multiple files
- avgminavgmax.py is used to calculate and output average minimum and maximum across all magnetic sensors
- jul20_gnuplotreadable.ino is an Arduino file used to read data from the sensors
- meteredplot6.py is used to graph the component strength and total strength of magnetic field data along a beam line
- plot6.py is used to graph the component strength and total strength of magnetic field data while stationary
- vectorfield3d.py is used to graph the total strength and direction of the magnetic field along the beam line
